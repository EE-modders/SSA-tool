# Empire Earth tool for the SSA archive format
Library and tools for working with Empire Earth SSA archive files

#### what is this?
this is a SSA libary and a SSA tool, which can be used to unpack those archives.

in the future I might add the option to pack the files back into the SSA format

## How to use it?

Download the latest version of the software from the [releases](https://github.com/EE-modders/SSA-tool/releases) page.

In order to unpack the archive, you just Drag&Drop the file onto the executable.

You can also use the CLI interface via a terminal.

The software runs standalone and no installation is needed. 

#### Supported games
- Empire Earth (base game)
- Empire Earth AoC (addon)
